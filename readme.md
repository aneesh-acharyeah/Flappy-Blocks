# Flappy Blocks 🟦

A minimal **Flappy Bird–style game** built with **vanilla JavaScript** and **HTML5 Canvas**. Fly a glowing neon block through the gaps in pipes and try to score as high as you can!

## 🎮 How to Play

* **Spacebar** or **Mouse Click** → Make the block jump.
* Avoid crashing into the pipes or falling off the screen.
* Each pipe you pass gives you **+1 score**.
* Game ends if you hit a pipe or the ground.
